    virtualenv env
    cd scripts
    activate (not in pycharm's terminal, doesn't work)
    django-admin startproject mysite
    django-admin startapp mysite

    We'll be using some packages; Request, so we can send requests with python
        pip install requests

        Now we'll use beautifulsoup, used to pull data from html.
            pip install beautifulsoup4


py manage.py shell
    import requests
    page = requests.get('http://google.com')    This will fail if no internet connection.
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup (case sensitive)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(page.text, 'html_parser')
    print(soup.prettify)

    Say we want this to look better, and grab every link on the page.
    soup.find_all('a')
    for link in soup.find_all('a'):
        print(link)          (shift enter for new line in shell)
    What if we specifically want the href links?
    for link in soup.find_all('a'):
        print(link.get('href'))
    exit() to close shell
